# 🚀 Next Actions: V2.0 "The Living Forest"

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** Phase G (Evolutionary UX) COMPLETE.
**Current Version:** 2.0.0 (Preview)

---

## 🟢 Recently Completed (Phase G)
We have successfully transformed the static tree into a "Biodynamic" system.
*   ✅ **DNA:** Rich Visualizations (Slicer, Vectors, Attention, Prediction).
*   ✅ **Seed:** New Intent Capture Flow.
*   ✅ **Tree:** Sprout Mode (LOD 2) & Semantic Zoom.
*   ✅ **Mobile:** Optimized for touch interaction ("Explorer Mode").

## 🎯 Immediate Priority: Launch Polish & Verification
Before declaring V2.0 live, we must ensure the content matches the quality of the new UX.

### 1. **Content & bridges (@SWARM)**
*   **Audit Content:** Ensure the 28 nodes have "Deep Dive" content worthy of the new "Micro-Lesson" UI.
*   **Program Links:** Verify that `node_metadata.related_program_id` is correctly driving traffic to AIKI/AIVO.
*   **Translation:** Sanity check Estonian translations for the new DNA/Tree terms.

### 2. **Technical Debt & Cleanup (@ANTIGRAVITY)**
*   **ParaglideJS:** Finish the partially completed migration (remove `next-intl` remnants).
*   **E2E Tests:** Update Playwright specs to account for the new `/seed` flow and D3 interactions.
*   **Performance:** Profile the D3 Tree with the new "Zoom Listeners" on mobile devices.

## 🧠 Strategic Note
The "Skeleton" (Code) is now world-class. The "Flesh" (Content) must now catch up.
We are moving from **Engineering Mode** -> **Gardening Mode**.
